[0:00] Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence. They don't seem to make any sense at all.
[0:05] Where do they come from... ...and what happens if you fall into one?
[0:15] Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms
[0:19] that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity. In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium
[0:26] releasing a tremendous amount of energy This energy, in the form of radiation, pushes against gravity,
[0:33] maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces. As long as there is fusion in the core, a star remains stable enough.
[0:41] But for stars with way more mass then our own sun the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements
[0:47] until they reach iron. Unlike all the elements that went before, the fusion process that creates iron
[0:54] doesn't generate any energy. Iron builds up at the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount
[1:00] and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken. The core collapses. Within a fraction of a second, the star implodes.
[1:09] Moving at about the quarter of the speed of light, feeding even more mass into the core.
[1:14] It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created, as the star dies, in a super nova explosion.
[1:22] This produces either a neutron star, or if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole.
[1:30] If you looked at a black hole, what you'd really be seeing is the event horizon. Anything that crosses the event horizon
[1:37] needs to be travelling faster than the speed of light to escape. In other words, its impossible. So we just see a black sphere
[1:44] reflecting nothing. But if the event horizon is the black part,
[1:49] what is the "hole" part of the black hole? The singularity. We're not sure what it is exactly. A singularity may be indefinitely dense,
[1:58] meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space, with no surface or volume, or something completely different.
[2:06] Right now, we just don't know. its like a "dividing by zero"error.
[2:10] By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner, If we were to swap the sun for an equally massive black hole, nothing much would change for earth,
[2:19] except that we would freeze to death, of course. what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole?
[2:24] The experience of time is different around black holes, from the outside, you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon,
[2:31] so time passes slower for you. at some point, you would appear to freeze in time, slowly turn red, and disapear. While from your perspective,
[2:40] you can watch the rest of the universe in fast forward, kind of like seeing into the future. Right now, we don't know what happens next,
[2:47] but we think it could be one of two things: One, you die a quick death. A black hole curves space so much,
[2:54] that once you cross the event horizon, there is only one possible direction. you can take this - literally - inside the event horizon,
[3:01] you can only go in one direction. Its like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step.
[3:08] The mass of a black hole is so concentrated, at some point even tiny distances of a few centimeters,
[3:14] would means that gravity acts with millions of times more force on different parts of your body. Your cells get torn apart,
[3:20] as your body stretches more and more, until you are a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide. Two, you die a very quick death.
[3:28] Very soon after you cross the event horizon, you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant.
[3:34] Neither of these options are particularly pleasant. How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole.
[3:41] A smaller black hole would kill you before you even enter its event horizon, while you probably could travel inside a super size massive black hole for quite a while. As a rule of thumb,
[3:50] the further away from the singularity you are, the longer you live. Black holes come in different sizes. There are stellar mass black holes,
[3:57] with a few times the mass of sun, and the diameter of an asteroid. And then there are the super massive black holes,
[4:04] which are found at the heart of every galaxy, and have been feeding for billions of years.
[4:09] Currently, the largest super massive black hole known, is S5 0014+81. 40 billion times the mass of our sun.
[4:18] It is 236.7 billion kilometers in diameter, which is 47 times the distance from the sun to Pluto.
[4:25] As powerful as black holes are, they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation.
[4:31] To understand how this works, we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty,
[4:37] but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and annihilating each other again. When this happens right on the edge of a black hole,
[4:44] one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole, and the other will escape and become a real particle. So the black hole is losing energy.
[4:52] This happens incredibly slowly at first, and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller. When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid,
[5:00] its radiating at room temperature. When it has the mass of a mountain, it radiates with about the heat of our sun. and in the last second of its life,
[5:07] the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion.
[5:12] But this process is incredibly slow, The biggest black holes we know, might take up a googol year to evaporate.
[5:19] This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away, nobody will be around to witness it. The universe will have become uninhabitable,
[5:27] long before then. This is not the end of our story, there are loads more interesting ideas about black holes, we'll explore them in part 2.
